# Arellano-Bond-LASSO

Here, you can find the R codes to implement the simulation study and application in the paper 'Arellano-Bond LASSO Estimator for Dynamic Linear Panel Models' by Chernozhukov V, Fern√°ndez-Val I, Huang C and Wang W. (arXiv preprint arXiv: 2402.00584).

The dataset for the application is initially provided by Chernozhukov V, Kasahara H, and Schrimpf P on the GitHub repository https://github.com/ubcecon/covid-schools. 
We aggregate the observations at the weekly level to avoid spurious serial correlation coming from the moving averages.
